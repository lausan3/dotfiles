# lausan3-dotfiles

A collection of my personal dotfiles and development machine tools


## The Tools I Use

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) - Raycast is my spotlight replacement of choice since it's extensible and includes many useful features by default (like the built-in calculator!)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - Neovim is my code editor since I love apps that let me customize things as I see fit and modding/plugins, as well as wanting to optimize the way I move around my codebase since I find that using my mouse to highlight chunks of code to be too slow.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I used to use VSC as my main code editor, but I have been attempting to switch to Vim for its vim motions for the longest time. Now, I use it for any language I haven't yet set up on my Neovim.
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) - I use Ghostty as my terminal because it's customizable and fast!
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)/Zsh - I use Zsh as my shell on MacOS because it's default, but I use Oh My Zsh to customize it since it's friendly and it looks nice.
- Theme - I use Tokyo Night Storm for basically every application :D
## Installation

I intend on creating a bash script to install everything I use here onto a different machine at some point
## Acknowledgements

- [Craftzdog's neovim setup](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public) - Craftzdog's neovim setup was a huge factor in inspiring me to adopt neovim into my workflow and creating my own setup! Many thanks to him for creating his videos that romanticize his life as an indie developer
